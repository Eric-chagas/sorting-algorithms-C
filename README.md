My personal C sorting algorithm storage.

## Present algorithms

### Elementary sorting algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
    + simple
    + faster
- Shell sort

### Powerful sorting algorithms
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

Most of the algorithms already include test case within the code so simply compile and run.
